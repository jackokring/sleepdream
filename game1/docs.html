<H1>The Games by Sleep Dream Games</H1>
<P>© 2013 Sleep Dream Games</P>
<P>So you've managed to press the ESC key, and brought up this
document. So it makes sense to provide you with more documentation
for your effort. We're like that. Most important is the keys used in
all the Games. Well, some are little applications, but for those who
know game theory, the point is moot. So keys up, with joypad button
numbers.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>ESC (4) – Go up one level in the menu, and perhaps exit.</P>
	<LI><P>TAB (1) – Go down one level in the menu, or pause activate.</P>
	<LI><P>SPACE (3) – The left mouse button emulation.</P>
	<LI><P>ENTER (2) – The right mouse button emulation.</P>
</UL>
<P>The following are also available by moving the mouse.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>UP</P>
	<LI><P>DOWN</P>
	<LI><P>LEFT</P>
	<LI><P>RIGHT</P>
</UL>
<P>Other keys will work in some of the text components. And hopefully
the mouse and a joypad or joystick works too. To put the mouse in joy mode press the BACKSPACE key.

<P><A HREF="https://raw.github.com/jackokring/sleepdream/master/game1/docs.html">The latest online documentation</A>
is available, and maybe a good indication of available updates. Or may help clarify some operational issues.
<A HREF="https://github.com/jackokring/sleepdream">The source is online here</A> for you. One file has been omitted,
as it contains a Raspberry Pi Store key, for access to network features. 
</P>
<H2>Astro Defender</H2>
<P>Floating in space. Defend the little people on the little planets,
while destroying everything else. SPACE controls the laser and ENTER
controls the smart bomb. This game is a hybrid of some of the best
1980s arcade action ideas.</P>
<H2>Zap</H2>
<P>All the action takes place on an evolving map. It's a very
sophisticated version of snake combined with some of the best aspects
of some other wonderful games. SPACE does a tail reverse, and ENTER
drops a bomb. Your goal is to eat everything that moves.</P>
<H2>Carnage</H2>
<P>A little 3D car racing game. Go round and round without falling
off the edge. SPACE and ENTER shift up and down the gearbox. The goal
is to shunt the other cars off the edge. The game has full rotary
mechanics.</P>
<H2>Grid</H2>
<P>Slide arround the screen edge, and shoot into the center. SPACE
operates the laser, and ENTER operates high points super fast mode.</P>
<H2>Train Yard</H2>
<P>Just the old classic keep the trains moving without a crash. SPACE
switches the selected points, while ENTER operates the points stop
light.</P>
<H2>Stunt Bike</H2>
<P>Get on yer bike. Do the stunt jumps. SPACE to do a wheelie, and
ENTER to crouch down.</P>
<H2>Ghost Chess</H2>
<P>Like chess, but with the added ghost pieces. Capture a piece and
it becomes a ghost piece on the ghost board. Capture or displace a
piece on the ghost board to bring it back to life on the main board.
On the ghost board the aim is to lose pieces to bring them back!
SPACE is select, and ENTER is take back move for beginners.</P>
<H2>Cascade Ripple</H2>
<P>Roll the dice, and drop the count of dots onto a square. When the
number of dots in a square is more than nine, eight of the dots are
moved into the squares arround it, and a point is awarded. SPACE is
select move and ENTER is the modulo-9 anti-move, a special move which
carries in dots from surrounding squares (worth no points). There is
no take back move.</P>
<H2>Across</H2>
<P>Roll the dice, and drop a line. Where it crosses another line a
kind of line Reversi will happen. Capture as much of the board as
possible. SPACE rotates the line, ENTER plays the move. There is no
move take back move.</P>
<H2>Magnetris</H2>
<P>A kind of Tetris with some extra magnetism. UP spins block, DOWN
drops block, SPACE flips poles of magnetism and ENTER is the super
loop reduction. You'll have to collect points to get one of those!</P>
<H2>Simplatronics</H2>
<P>Put together some simplified electronics between the inputs and
outputs to make the solution. Pop, bang, fizzle! SPACE is component
select move and place, and ENTER is test circuit.</P>
<H2>Make Words</H2>
<P>The grid of letters appears. Nudge rows or columns to make word
scores. SPACE for nudge or select mode, and ENTER to cheat at half
score.</P>
<H2>Music Synth</H2>
<P>A little musical sequencer, for making small musical compositions.
SPACE to edit and exit edit, ENTER for note mute.</P>
<H2>Sound Evolver</H2>
<P>Evolve some nice noises, and some not so nice ones. SPACE does
evolved randomization while ENTER allows you to save the sound as a
file for use in many other musical software applications.</P>
<H2>Calculator</H2>
<P>A simple scientific calculator.</P>
<H2>Extras</H2>
<P>The extras menu.</P>
